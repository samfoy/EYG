#EYG - Eye Gaze Keyboard
###Samuel Painter

Eye Gaze Keyboard is a touch optimized text entry interface based upon the Eye
Gaze input method.



####Updates:

* EYG is now fully functional. It can be used for most text editing purposes.
  I would like to speed it up but that doesn't seem possible in this form.

* Can now do most basic text editing for alpha. Deciding now what will be the
  best way to implement numbers.

* Keyboard now has rudimentary function, most added things will be features

* Added inital javascript, this is not the eventual intended function, but
  a placeholder for later.

* As you may be able to tell, some of the html and css has been implemented.
I have also realized that it will be necessary to create a mobile version that
is somewhat scaled/down
