#EYG - Eye Gaze Keyboard
###Samuel Painter

Eye Gaze Keyboard is a touch optimized text entry interface based upon the Eye
Gaze input method.

At the moment, it is being coded in javascript, but with an eye toward a future
android implementation this may change. 


####Updates:

* Keyboard now has rudimentary function, most added things will be features

* Added inital javascript, this is not the eventual intended function, but
  a placeholder for later.

* As you may be able to tell, some of the html and css has been implemented.
I have also realized that it will be necessary to create a mobile version that
is somewhat scaled/down
